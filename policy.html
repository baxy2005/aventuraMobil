<h2>Hostel policy & House rules</h2>
<h3>Smoking</h3>
  <p>The entire area of the hostel is a non smoking zone. </p>
  
  <h3>Quiet Time</h3>
  <p>Aventura Boutique Hostel is located in a classic residential building in the heart of Budapest. We like our neighbors and want to maintain a good relationship with them. So please avoid making noise after 10 pm and please be generally mindful of their presence as you move around the building. There is no curfew, but we ask you to not disturb others when returning to the hostel late at night. </p>
  
  <h3>Kitchen</h3>
  <p>After use, please leave kitchen clean and tidy. Wash your dirty dishes.
  When placing food in the fridge, please write your name and your check-out date on it.</p>
  
 <h3> Laundry</h3>
 <p> Laundry is EUR 5/load (including washing powder, fabric softener and colour protection). Just place your laundry in the washing machine and let the staff start the program.</p>
  
 <h3> Cleanliness</h3>
 <p> Please keep your room and common areas of the hostel clean and tidy to help us maintain the cozy and friendly atmosphere we're dedicated to welcome all our guests with. </p>
  
 <h3> Damage</h3>
  <p>If you lose or damage any property belonging to Aventura Boutique Hostel Budapest, we will have to charge you for it. The compensation must be paid immediately and in cash.</p>
  
 <h3> Conservation</h3>
 <p> The Earth's energy resources are rapidly being depleted. Please conserve water, gas, and electricity in the hostel as well. Don't leave the water running when you don't really need it. Please turn out the light when you leave a room. And please turn the gas off when you've finished cooking.</p>
  
 <h3> Personal belongings</h3>
 <p> Please, look after your personal belongings! Use the lockers under the beds! We cannot take responsibility for any loss, theft or damage to any guest property whatever the cause. </p>
  
 <h3> Bookings and Payment</h3>
  <p>Bookings through the internet: When booking online  (HostelWorld or HostelBookers) you will be charged a 10% deposit. This is automatically taken by the booking engine and not by Aventura Boutique Hostel Budapest. It is non-refundable and non-transferable. The deposit is calculated on a per person per night basis. Changes in a reservation to the number of people or nights could result in a loss of some or all of your deposit. </p>
  <p>For payment we accept Euros and Hungarian Forints (HUF). We cannot accept cheques or credit cards. Hungarian Forint prices are calculated daily, based on the official exchange rate of the Hungarian National Bank (www.mnb.hu).
 <p> If you wish to change your reservation at arrival to the hostel or during your stay in Budapest, we have the right to charge the half of the total cost of your booking!</p>
  <p>For group reservations or longer stays, we ask for deposit. If your reservation fee is more than 350 EUR we ask for a 40% deposit. The deposit is not refundeble in case of cancellation. We can only secure your booking if we receive the deposit. </p>
